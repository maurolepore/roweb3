and "2019-06-04" to your publication date.

We recommend the use of [Hugo shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) to include images, tweets, videos, gists, etc.

**Add an image** by using a Hugo shortcode. The image is saved under `/content/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/name-of-image.png`.

{{< figure src = "name-of-image.png" width = "400" alt = "this is the alternative text" >}}

Consult the Technical Guidelines for tips on changing image size, alignment, and for advice on alternative text.

**Embed a tweet** by using a Hugo shortcode.
